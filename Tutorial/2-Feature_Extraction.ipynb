    "# **Machine learning with coral reef soundscape data**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a supporting tutorial for the study **Unlocking the soundscape of coral reefs with artificial intelligence: pretrained networks and unsupervised learning win out** by [Williams et al (2024a)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.02.578582v1). If you use any of these methods after reading this then please cite the article.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this publication we recommend combining pretrained neural networks with unsupervised learning for analysing soundscape ecology.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What this notebook does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up: access some sample data and install the required packages we need.\n",
    "2. Extract features from the audio data using the SurfPerch pretrained neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **SurfPerch: A pretrained neural network fine tuned to coral reefs**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the associated study to this tutorial we used VGGish. However, here we will use SurfPerch, a newly developed pretrained neural network fine tuned to coral reefs which we created in a collaboration with Google DeepMind. It was created and rigorously tested on audio data from 16 unique datasets across 12 countries. You can read more about the network in its supporting research article **Leveraging tropical reef, bird and unrelated sounds for superior transfer learning in marine bioacoustics**, [Williams et al (2024b)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16436).\n",
    "\n",
    "SurfPerch can also be used to rapidly identify individual sounds in your data, as opposed to the whole soundscape approach presented in **Unlocking the soundscape of coral reefs with artificial intelligence** by [Williams et al (2024a)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.02.578582v1). See a full tutorial on identifying individual sounds [here](https://github.com/BenUCL/surfperch/blob/surfperch/SurfPerch_Demo_with_Calling_in_Our_Corals.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Our sample data**\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use a small sample dataset for this tutorial. This data consists of 262 audio files from healthy, degraded and restored coral reefs in Indonesia. These reefs are part of the worlds largest coral reef restoration program [buildingcoral.com](https://www.buildingcoral.com/). See [Williams et al (2022) ](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.108986) for more detail on this audio."
