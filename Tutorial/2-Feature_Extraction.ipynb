        "In the associated study to this tutorial we used VGGIsh. However, here we will use SurfPerch, a newly developed pretrained neural network fine tuned to coral reefs which we created in a collaboration with Google DeepMind. It was created and rigorously tested on audio data from 16 unique datasets across 12 countries. You can read more about the network in its supporting research article **Leveraging tropical reef, bird and unrelated sounds for superior transfer learning in marine bioacoustics**, [Williams et al (2024b)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16436).\n",
